JS projects
===========
This is a collection of JS tasks, that I created just for fun or while trying new things.

####1. `draggable_elements_with_color_picker`
__Short task that shows how to create draggable elements with color picker.__
<br />View [demo](http://onora.github.io/JS-projects/draggable_elements_with_color_picker/)

Basic requirements:

1. Create a `toolbar` with two buttons. After clicking the first button element `Button` is created and after clicking the second button element `Text` is created. The two types of element represent `div` with text and some background.
2. Create unlimited elements of both types by clicking on the toolbar buttons.
3. `Color picker` is visualized by double clicking on each created element and you can change background color of each created element. The `color picker` is the same for each created element. It gets the current color of the elements and after choosing new one set it to the element.
4. All elements are draggable:  `toolbar`, `created elements` and `color picker`.
