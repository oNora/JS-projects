<br />Demo link: http://onora.github.io/draggable_elements_with_color_picker/

Basic requirements:

1. Create a `toolbar` with two buttons. After clicking the first button element `Button` is created and after clicking the second button element `Text` is created. The two types of element represent `div` with text and some background. 
2. Create unlimited elements of both types by clicking on the toolbar buttons.
3. `Color picker` is visualized by double clicking on each created element and you can change background color of each created element. The `color picker` is the same for each created element. It gets the current color of the elements and after choosing new one set it to the element.
4. All elements are draggable:  `toolbar`, `created elements` and `color picker`.
